Ritz, who had previously worked at the Savoy Hotel in London and the Hôtel Majestic in Paris, aimed to create a luxurious hotel that would cater to the needs of the wealthy and aristocratic elite.

It is the oldest bridge in Paris that is still standing and was originally the first bridge to be built without houses or shops on it.\n\nThe construction of Pont Neuf began in 1577 and was completed in 1607. The bridge was commissioned by King Henry III and took 30 years to finish due to various obstacles and changes in design. The original architect of the bridge was Pierre Esprit, but he died in 1579 before its completion. \n\nThe bridge was designed by King Henry IV and architect François Mansart, who envisioned a bridge that would be a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture. Pont Neuf was an engineering marvel at the time, with a single, unbroken span of 232 meters (761 feet) that crossed the Seine River.\n\nPont Neuf was also a groundbreaking innovation in urban planning, as it was the first bridge in Paris to be designed without houses or shops on it. This decision was made to improve the flow of traffic and to create a more open and airy space for pedestrians. The bridge was also designed with the intention of being a symbol of the power and grandeur of the French monarchy.\n\nOver the centuries, Pont Neuf has undergone several restorations and renovations. In the 18th century, the bridge\'s pavement and railings were rebuilt, and in the 19th century, the bridge\'s stone piers were strengthened. In the 20th century, Pont Neuf underwent a major restoration project to repair damage caused by World War II bombing and to restore its original appearance.\n\nToday, Pont Neuf is a popular tourist destination and a beloved landmark in Paris. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the most iconic and historic bridges in the world.'
